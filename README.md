# ❤️‍🔥 Hi, I'm Parker.

I'm currently a Software Engineering student at Cal Poly, pursuing a master's focused on AI fundamentals and psychology. My goal is to deeply understand both the technical side of software and AI, and the human needs they're built to serve—bridging the gap thoughtfully between these worlds.

I work part-time at OpenAI, leading an expansion of their student Lab Ambassador program. Some of my recent projects connected to that work include:

* **[ChatGPT Lab Onboard](https://hostastudentlab.com/intro)** – Guided toolkit helping students organize peer-led AI workshops.
* **[Personify](https://personifychat.netlify.app/)** – Easy-to-use interface for personalizing ChatGPT interactions.
* **[Poly Prompt Website](https://polyprompt.netlify.app/)** – Informational site for Cal Poly’s first OpenAI-sponsored hackathon.
* **[ChatStudentTuning](https://studentchat.netlify.app/onboarding)** – Quick-start tool to help students tailor ChatGPT instructions.
* **The Collective** – Platform to research and showcase how students meaningfully use AI.

Beyond these, I actively collaborate often via Github on various team projects and hackathons, many of which aren't hosted directly on my profile.

My most extensive personal side project—and the one closest to my heart—is **Poly Canyon**, an app and digital archive created to preserve and celebrate the architectural history of Cal Poly's iconic outdoor museum:

* [**Poly Canyon App**](https://polycanyon.com/download) – Interactive mobile app for exploring Cal Poly’s architectural structures.
* [**Poly Canyon Website**](https://polycanyon.com/) – Comprehensive digital archive detailing Poly Canyon’s historical narrative.
