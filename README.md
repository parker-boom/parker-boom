# Hi, I'm Parker! ❤️‍🔥

## 🧑🏼 WHO I AM  
I'm a Software Engineering student at Cal Poly who sees coding as both a process and an outcome. It's a creative outlet guided by important principles but also a real way to make life better by creating impactful products for people. I mix technical knowledge with insights from human psychology and design to build systems that "just work" for people. 

I have a lot of life-experience beyond just my technical projects. I'd love for you to check that out [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parker-jones-ai/). 

## 🧠 MY PHILOSOPHY  
We’re living in a time when AI isn’t just transforming technology, it’s making us question how we use and interact with it. For me, the goal is simple: use AI to build applications that are not only faster and more efficient but truly enhance human experiences. Right now, this means being agile and using AI to build better products, in the future, this means puting AI directly in users hands. I believe in leveraging technology responsibly, putting user needs first, and ensuring that every innovation makes a positive impact.

## 🖥️ MY PROJECTS  
Here are the projects I am most proud of. I was the sole developer on all 3. See them pinned below.
- **Poly Canyon App:** *This app helped revitilaze exploration of an outdoor archecturical museum at Cal Poly. It is my most used product.*  
- **Poly Canyon Website:** *This website built off the app and provided historical context to the area. It is my best design work.*  
- **The Scoop:** *This project won me 1st place in a hackathon and was created in a weekend!*

## 🔮 MY FUTURE  
I'm gearing up for a master’s degree focused on designing AI systems that prioritize human interaction. My ambition is to work on both the core and the front end of AI—making sure that the technology we build not only pushes boundaries but also enhances everyday life in a meaningful way. Technological innovation is impressive, but the promises of its story are not guranteed, they must be built. I'm ready to build them.
